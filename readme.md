### Adding your city

Edit the [`api/v1/cities.json`](api/v1/cities.json) file.

### Adding a new venue

The city venue files use GeoJSON format.
To find more about GeoJSON check [the GitHub help](https://help.github.com/articles/mapping-geojson-files-on-github).

If your city venue file exists, you should find it inside the `api/v1/locations/` folder.

You will want to edit it and append a new entry to `features`.

If you city does not exist, create a new one using the same filename as the city `id`.

Check the existing files for boilerplate data before creating a new file.
